- Functional interfaces;
- References to methods and constructors;
- Repeatable annotations;
- Annotations on data types;
- Reflection for method parameters;
- Stream API for working with collections;
- ....

## Q1. In Java, How many ways you can take input from the console?

In Java, there are three different ways for reading input from the user in the command line environment (console).

### Using Buffered Reader Class

This method is used by wrapping the System.in ( standard input stream ) in an InputStreamReader which is wrapped in a BufferedReader, we can read input from the user in the command line.

```Java
/**
 * Buffered Reader Class
 */
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Enter data using BufferReader
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        // Reading data using readLine
        String name = reader.readLine();

        // Printing the read line
        System.out.println(name);
    }
}
```

### Using Scanner Class

The main purpose of the Scanner class is to parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions, however it is also can be used to read input from the user in the command line.

```Java
/**
 * Scanner Class
 */
import java.util.Scanner;

class GetInputFromUser {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        // Using Scanner for Getting Input from User
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        String s = in.nextLine();
        System.out.println("You entered string " + s);

        int a = in.nextInt();
        System.out.println("You entered integer " + a);

        float b = in.nextFloat();
        System.out.println("You entered float " + b);
    }
}
```

### Using Console Class

It has been becoming a preferred way for reading user's input from the command line. In addition, it can be used for reading password-like input without echoing the characters entered by the user; the format string syntax can also be used ( like System.out.printf() ).

```Java
/**
 * Console Class
 */
public class Sample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using Console to input data from user
        String name = System.console().readLine();
        System.out.println(name);
    }
}
```

## Add interactive elements

### Tabs
To add switchable content, you can make use of tabs (inject them by starting to type `tab` on a new line):

<tabs>
    <tab title="Markdown">
        <code-block lang="plain text">![Alt Text](new_topic_options.png){ width=450 }</code-block>
    </tab>
    <tab title="Semantic markup">
        <code-block lang="xml">
            <![CDATA[<img src="new_topic_options.png" alt="Alt text" width="450px"/>]]></code-block>
    </tab>
</tabs>

### Collapsible blocks
Apart from injecting entire XML elements, you can use attributes to configure the behavior of certain elements.
For example, you can collapse a chapter that contains non-essential information:

#### Supplementary info {collapsible="true"}
Content under a collapsible header will be collapsed by default,
but you can modify the behavior by adding the following attribute:
`default-state="expanded"`

### Convert selection to XML
If you need to extend an element with more functions, you can convert selected content from Markdown to semantic markup.
For example, if you want to merge cells in a table, it's much easier to convert it to XML than do this in Markdown.
Position the caret anywhere in the table and press <shortcut>Alt+Enter</shortcut>:

<img src="convert_table_to_xml.png" alt="Convert table to XML" width="706" border-effect="line"/>
